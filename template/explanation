- related to data
    - k:                                    if the dataset is non-graph dataset, you need to set k to construct knn graph
    - t:                                    if the model need to calculate the matrix M like DAEGC, default None denotes needn't, int denotes need
    - adj_norm:                             whether to normalize adj, default value is False. If necessary, you must use '--norm' or '-N' to normalize
    - adj_symmetric                         the adj is symmetric or asymmetric, default value is True. If necessary, you must use '--symmetric_false' or '-SF' to change it to false
    - adj_loop                              whether the adj has self-loop, default value is True. If necessary, you must use '--self_loop_false' or '-SLF' to change it to false
    - feature_type                          the datatype of feature, "tensor" and "npy" are available, default "tensor"
    - label_type                            the datatype of label, "tensor" and "npy" are available, default "npy"
    - adj_type                              the datatype of adj, "tensor" and "npy" are available, default "tensor"

- related to experiments
    - seed                                  the random seed
    - is_pretrain                           is this experiment pretraining, default value is False
    - loops                                 the number of training rounds
    - desc                                  the description of this experiments. please don't use space between words, you can use '_' to connect
    - model_name                            the model you want to train. please make sure that it is uppercase of formal training or lowercase of pretraining and correspond with the model name in model directory

- related to path
    - root                                  the root path of your model, default None denotes using the relative path, if necessary, you can set it to your root path to switch the relative path to absolute

    # if your model has more than one pretrain modules, the pretrain module save path name are:
    - pretrain_{module name}_save_path      the path to save pretrain .pkl file. The relative path format is './pretrain/pretrain_{module name}/{model name}/{dataset name}/'
    # such as:
    - pretrain_ae_save_path„ÄÅpretrain_gae_save_path
    # if your model only have one pretrain module, the filename is:
    - pretrain_save_path                    the path to save pretrain .pkl file. The relative path format is './pretrain/pretrain_{module name}/{model name}/{dataset name}/'
    - log_save_path                         the path to save log file. The relative path format is './log/{model name}/{dataset name}/'
    - dataset_path                          the root path of dataset used in load_data.py. The relative path format is './'. This couldn't be changed.
    - clustering_tsne_save_path             the path to save the clustering tsne image. The relative path format is './img/clustering/{model name}/{dataset name}/'
    - embedding_heatmap_save_path           the path to save the embedding heatmap image. The relative path format is './img/heatmap/{model name}/{dataset name}/'

    # if you change the root path, '.' in the relative path will be replaced with root path. As a result, the ending of root shouldn't include '/'.
- related to drawing
    - plot_clustering_tsne                  if you want to draw the clustering tsne image, you need to use '-tsne' or '-TS'
    - plot_embedding_heatmap                if you want to draw the embedding heatmap image, you need to use '-heatmap' or '-T'
